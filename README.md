# ptfb-griffinot

Our programme is designed to teach you how to help your child to improve their fine motor skills.
The programme is broken into six different sections. There are four levels that support fine motor skill development.  Then, there are two additional sections designed to specifically help with pencil grasp and scissor skills.   

## user journey
- As a parent of a child with SEN, I can use the app to find the best place to start helping my child by myself (using the GriffinOT programs)
- As a parent of a child with SEN, I can find relevant resources for supporting myself and my child 

## Problem statement 
Parents who have recently discovered that their child has SEN need a way to feel in control of their child’s journey because at the moment the information and support provided is too fragmented and therefore hard to access.

## Solution
Making this website to best support parents in supporting their children , they can use the videos provided in the app to improve their child’s motor skills,and they know what activites to do to help their child improve, and how to do them correctly.
